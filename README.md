# orinoco

This is the front-end server for Project 5 (Orinoco) of the Junior Web Developer path. Clone this repo. 

To be able to view the app correctly, clone the back-end server for this project (https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5). From within the project folder, run npm install. You can then run the server with node server. The server should run on localhost with default port 3000. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.

Open the front-end with Live Server and everything should work correctly.
